This program is the main program for our GPS, where we connect to client to receive messages, calculate distances, send to adafruit, and send to AWS IoT through MQTT functions
-We initialise a host IP number and port number. Then we start listening for incoming connections on that host (throught the initialise() function)
-Once we received lat longs from the client, we will pass the values to update the map in Adafruit
-We will conduct checks to see if our gps is within the predefined circle or not, and send the data to adafruit and AWS IoT respectively.
